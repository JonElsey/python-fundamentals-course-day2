This portion of the course is focused more on a) some best practices when writing code, and b) doing
some slightly more complex data analysis tasks using the Pandas and netCDF4 libraries.

Some of the things you learn here will show you a different way to do things
you've probably done before - this does not mean that either way is "right"
or "wrong", but as you become more experienced you'll become aware of
when it's more appropriate to use particular techniques.



### Getting Started
To get started, follow the directions on the "[Setup][lesson-setup]" page to download data
and install a Python interpreter.
