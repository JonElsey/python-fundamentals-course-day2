# Things to try and think about when writing code

* Coding is difficult!
  
  If you get stuff wrong, that's OK! You will 100% write code that doesn't work, or has bugs in it. *This is normal!* I've been writing code in Python for 10 years and still get basic stuff wrong.

* Don't get discouraged!

  The best thing to do is to have a go at solving the problem. Worst case - your code throws an error. Think about what is causing the error, solve it, and move onto the next one! Each time you solve an error, you will know what to do when it occurs again next time. See fixing problems as an opportunity for growth rather than something negative.

# Additional training

ARCCA have some training courses available on their [website](https://arcca.github.io), which I recommend. They tend to run these a few times a year, or you can work through the material in your own time. 

ARCCA's courses (and indeed this one!) are based to various degrees on courses developed by an organisation called The Carpentries. You can find their software lessons [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Additional lessons are available on the [Data Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) website; these tend to focus on more specific but still potentially relevant things. These are also highly recommended!
