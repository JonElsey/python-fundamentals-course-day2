# Things to try and think about when writing code


# Additional training

ARCCA have some training courses available on their [website](https://arcca.github.io), which I recommend. They tend to run these a few times a year, or you can work through the material in your own time. 
These courses (and this one!) are based on courses developed by an organisation called The Carpentries. You can find their software lessons [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/). Additional lessons are available on the [Data Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) website; these tend to focus on more specific but still potentially relevant things. These are also highly recommended!
